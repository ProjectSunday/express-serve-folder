# Challenge: express serve folder

## Instructions

1. Clone down this repo.

2. Run `npm install` then `npm start`.

3. Create a new branch called [your username]-dev (e.g. hai5guy-dev) off the master branch

4. There's a folder called src/img that contains 3 images (garfield, oddie, and jon).  There can be MANY more images added as development continues.  Change the app to serve the entire folder, NOT each file because you won't know what the files will be in the future.

5. Do a pull request of your branch into the master branch.

## Desire Results

On the first page, a picture of garfield must appear.  If more images are added to the src/img folder, those images should be accessible from the front end.
